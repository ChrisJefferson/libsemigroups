# libsemigroups - A C++ library for semigroups and monoids
### by [J. D. Mitchell](http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/) with contributions by [J. Jonusas](http://www-circa.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~julius/) and [M. Torpey](http://www-circa.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mct25/)

## Introduction
libsemigroups is a C++ library for semigroups and monoids; it is partly based on 
[Algorithms for computing finite semigroups](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf), 
[Expository Slides](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf), and 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html) by Jean-Eric Pin.

The libsemigroups library is used in the [Semigroups package for GAP](https://gap-packages.github.io/Semigroups/).

The current version of libsemigroups is 0.1.0 from ??/03/2017.

## Documentation
The C++ library API is generated using
[cldoc](https://github.com/jessevdk/cldoc) and available
[here](http://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/).

## Dependencies

libsemigroups requires a C++ compiler supporting the c++11 standard.
